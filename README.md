## Repository Structure

The repository consists of one folder per exercise, each one with a script and suplementary files.  

 

An assignment I enjoyed doing was "Readability" since it was very well structured and satisfying. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/Brunohoc/cs50-course/blob/main/readability/readability.c).
